# hass-mqtt

Idea and generation code taken from https://github.com/W-Floyd/ha-mqtt-iot which is a very well done project but setup
for a singular use. I wanted to be able to just use Home Assistant Devices/Entities in other programs so extendign what
was done there.

Massive work in progress right now.
